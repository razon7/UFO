From the above picture, we can see the data that has been filtered based on the user input, like state: ny.


**Summary**:
  
  Some drawbacks and recommendations:
  
The entire webpage is lengthy with all the data displayed at a stretch. 

The search criteria capablity to have much wider range. (Eg: the user may use either upper case or lower case but still can find the search results)

For a new user who is exploring  this webpage for the first time, we could add the dropdown menu for increasing their experience more positive.
